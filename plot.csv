start1,start2,🧒🏽,green,"Hello @everybody! I'm Carmo and I'm 11 years old!
I'm selling lemonade in front of our house just off the praça, come buy some please! 💖"
start2,,🦜,,"Hi @🧒🏽, That's so cute! I'll come take a look right now!"
sale1,sale2,🦜,,"That hit the spot, highly recommended!"
sale2,sale3,🧒🏽,green,"Thank you for your business, @🦜!"
sale3,sale4,🐶,,"Hmm, I could use a refreshing drink too. ☀️ 👍
I'll be there in a bit."
sale4,sale5,🏖️,,Me too!
sale5,,🧒🏽,green,"I’ve still got plenty! ...uh, kind of."
out_of_lemons1,,🧒🏽,green,"Yeah, I'm all out. 🤦
Hang on everybody, I have to go grab some more from the store. Back in a bit!"
bought_lemons1,bought_lemons2,🧒🏽,green,"There we go, lemons back in stock. Thanks, @🏪!"
bought_lemons2,bought_lemons3,🏪,pink,"Happy to help a fellow businesswoman! 😹

We have plenty of other things in stock if your business takes off and you have more money to spend."
bought_lemons3,bought_lemons4,🧒🏽,green,"Ooh, like what? 😲"
bought_lemons4,bought_lemons5,🏪,pink,"Well, we have some very nice glitter glue pens so you can make a fancy sign for your lemonade business. ✨"
bought_lemons5,bought_lemons6,🏪,pink,"And a nice, cheap solar charger for your phone so you don’t need to run inside when the battery gets low."
bought_lemons6,bought_lemons7,🏪,pink,"🤔 And I guess we also have an ice machine in stock if you’re running out of that a lot, that one’s kind of expensive though."
bought_lemons7,bought_lemons_final,🧒🏽,green,"I already have a solar charger! Mom gave me one for my birthday, it’s so neat!
Those other two sound very useful though.
For my business."
bought_lemons_final,,🏪,pink,🤣👍
bought_glitter_pens1,bought_glitter_pens2,🏪,pink,"Thank you for stopping by and showing me the sign you drew with the glitter pens, @🧒🏽.
It was very impressive!"
bought_glitter_pens2,bought_glitter_pens3,🧒🏽,green,I bet people will come buy lemonade twice as fast now! ✨✨
bought_glitter_pens3,,🏪,pink,"I wouldn’t be surprised, yeah. 🙂"
bought_ice_machine1,bought_ice_machine2,🧒🏽,green,"That new ice machine is so fast! I really like it! ⛄
Do you have another one?"
bought_ice_machine2,,🏪,pink,"Just how much lemonade do you think you’re going to sell?! 🤣
I’ll have to order in a new one, they take up quite a bit of space and don’t usually sell all that quickly. I’ll let you know when it comes in."
misc1,misc1b,🏖️,,"Just what I needed after a day in the sun, thank you @🧒🏽!"
misc1b,,🧒🏽,green,"You’re welcome, @🏖️!"
misc2,misc2b,🐶,,"I just can't get enough of this lemonade, it's delicious.
🍹✨"
misc2b,,🧒🏽,green,Thank you! ✨
misc3,,🏍️,,"Thanks for letting me fill up my thermos with lemonade, that should keep me going on my tour of the island today."
misc4,misc4b,🏖️,,This really is excellent lemonade. 💛
misc4b,,🦜,,I could do with another round as well…
misc5,,🏍️,,"...I accidentally drank it all before lunch, I’ll come by for a refill in a bit!"
misc6,misc6b,🐶,,More lemonade! Give me more!
misc6b,,🏍️,,"Are you doing okay there, @🐶?
It is good though, I’ll admit I could go for some more as well."
saplings1,saplings2,🏪,pink,"If you're interested, @🧒🏽, I can also sell you some lemon tree saplings so you could grow your own lemons.

They should do okay in your backyard if you water them regularly."
saplings2,saplings3,🧒🏽,green,"Oooh, that sounds like fun!
Wouldn't that take a long time though?"
saplings3,saplings4,🏪,pink,"Hah! I guess it would, at least 5-6 years.
There are no magic shortcuts when it comes to stuff like this."
saplings4,saplings5,👁️‍🗨️,white,That's not <b>entirely</b> true...
saplings5,saplings6,🧒🏽,green,"What do you mean, @👁️‍🗨️? 😲"
saplings6,,👁️‍🗨️,white,"Easiest just to show you, I'll be right over..."
saplings7,saplings8,🧒🏽,green,"@🏪, I'm coming to buy one of your saplings!
I have a magic potion that will make them grow super fast."
saplings8,saplings9,🏪,pink,"I don't know what @👁️‍🗨️ told you, but I don't think that's a real thing. 😕
I'll gladly sell you a sapling if you want one though. Just don't expect too much."
saplings9,,🧒🏽,green,"Hmmm, I’m going to try it! ✨"
saplings10,saplings11,🧒🏽,green,"It’s working! 🙌
Now this is more like it, it’s already larger than I am!!"
saplings11,saplings12,🏪,pink,"...wait, really? What did you sell her, @👁️‍🗨️?"
saplings12,saplings13,🧒🏽,green,@🏪 It was a gift! I didn’t need to pay anything.
saplings13,saplings14,👁️‍🗨️,white,I just wan ted to hel p.
saplings14,,🧒🏽,green,"This is going to help me a bunch, thank you @👁️‍🗨️!
And @🏪, I’m going to buy so many of your saplings! This is fun!"
more_potion1,more_potion2,🧒🏽,green,"@👁️‍🗨️ Huh, that bottle of potion you gave me is starting to look pretty empty… do you have more?"
more_potion2,more_potion3,👁️‍🗨️,white,S ure! I will gladly sel l you more potion.
more_potion3,more_potion4,🧒🏽,green,Yay! How much does it cost? I have money_amount saved up.
more_potion4,more_potion5,👁️‍🗨️,white,"No need for any of that. W I want to trade.
You bring me lemons, I give you more potion."
more_potion5,,🧒🏽,green,"That works even better, the first trees are already growing lemons! ✨"
worried_store1,worried_store2,🏪,pink,"@everybody I’m not sure what is going on today, but I’m going to have to limit the amount of lemons people are allowed to buy to 1 bag per customer."
worried_store2,worried_store3,🦜,,That’s so unfair!
worried_store3,worried_store4,🏪,pink,"@🦜 if I wouldn’t, I’d be out in the next hour.
People have really been going crazy today…"
worried_store4,worried_store5,🧒🏽,green,"I’m sorry, @🏪! I know I bought, like, a whole bunch of them."
worried_store5,worried_store6,🏪,pink,"You’re fine, @🧒🏽. Don’t worry. 😊
Some other people just are going crazy for them today."
worried_store6,worried_store7,🐶,,"We need more lemons!
You can’t cut us off like this."
worried_store7,,🏪,pink,"Wah, cut you off? You’re worrying me, @🐶.
Also, I can’t stop you from chomping down on lemons as soon as you’ve paid for them, but, uh…
(Yes, I saw you.)"
more_magic1,more_magic2,🧒🏽,green,"@👁️‍🗨️ So… when you said you had more magic, did you just mean more potion?"
more_magic2,more_magic3,👁️‍🗨️,white,"No t at all, we have m uch magic. We can strengthen the magical potion for you and also pro vide you with other magic."
more_magic3,more_magic4,🧒🏽,green,Make the potion stronger? 😲 Stronger how?
more_magic4,more_magic5,👁️‍🗨️,white,"Every way. F aster growth, more lemon ade produced, tastier lemon ade."
more_magic5,more_magic6,🧒🏽,green,I want that! Can I just bring you more lemons for that?
more_magic6,,👁️‍🗨️,white,Yes p lease. I n eed more lemons.
more_magic7,more_magic8,🧒🏽,green,Alright! I’ll start saving them up. ✨
more_magic8,more_magic9,🧒🏽,green,"...when you say other magic, what kind of magic do you have?"
more_magic9,more_magic10,👁️‍🗨️,white,A ll s orts. What w ould you like?
more_magic10,more_magic11,🧒🏽,green,"All sorts? Like, even magical animals?!"
more_magic11,more_magic12,👁️‍🗨️,white,"We can m ake those, de finitely."
more_magic12,more_magic13,👁️‍🗨️,white,What k ind of animal do you want? It w ould take many lemons.
more_magic13,more_magic14,🧒🏽,green,"A unicorn, obviously!! 🎉"
more_magic14,more_magic15,👁️‍🗨️,white,What is a uni corn?
more_magic15,more_magic16,🧒🏽,green,"You don’t know what a unicorn is? 😲
They’re the best!"
more_magic16,more_magic17,👁️‍🗨️,white,"One of these?
<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn</a>"
more_magic17,more_magic18,🧒🏽,green,"Yeah! But, like, even more magic!"
more_magic18,more_magic19,👁️‍🗨️,white,Ex plain?
more_magic19,more_magic20,🧒🏽,green,"Can you make it so it can understand what I say? And is super big and strong? And give it the softest hair!
And so it can make cupcakes from its horn!! With different frostings every time!"
more_magic20,more_magic21,👁️‍🗨️,white,I- yes? Yes. This will take a lot of e ffort to accom plish but it is not impossible.
more_magic21,more_magic22,🧒🏽,green,"So you’d need, like, a million lemons or something?"
more_magic22,more_magic23,👁️‍🗨️,white,Is that a lot?
more_magic23,more_magic24,🧒🏽,green,"Yeah, that’s like one of the biggest numbers there is."
more_magic24,,👁️‍🗨️,white,Then yes. A mill ion lemons.
more_magic25,more_magic26,🧒🏽,green,That’s going to take a while to gather…

first_magic_upgrade_bought2,,👁️‍🗨️,white,This is di fferent to anything we have ev er done. It… inter ests us.
second_magic_upgrade_bought1,second_magic_upgrade_bought2,👁️‍🗨️,white,That one sh ould help you a lot to make more lemons.
second_magic_upgrade_bought2,,👁️‍🗨️,white,Which is go od because the unicorn is almost done. The cupcake pro duction was es pecially trick y.
unicorn_bought1,unicorn_bought2,🧒🏽,green,"Oh my goodness, you’re perfect! ✨🦄✨
You’re so big! And shiny! And kind!
@everybody I’m writing this from the top of my own unicorn!"
unicorn_bought2,unicorn_bought3,🧒🏽,green,"🤔 What to name you… Anastasia? Fernando?
I can’t tell if you’re a boy unicorn or a girl unicorn…
I should have asked for you to be able to talk!"
unicorn_bought3,worried_mom,🧒🏽,green,...where is everybody anyway?
worried_mom,dev_notice_end_of_content,👩🏽‍✈️ ,white,"@🧒🏽, please tell me you’re safe!
My flight just got rerouted to São Filipe. Something about a mass riot on the island?
Stay inside, lock the doors, write me back, please."
