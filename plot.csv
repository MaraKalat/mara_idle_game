saplings1,saplings2,🏪,pink,"If you're interested, @🧒🏽, I can also sell you some lemon tree saplings so you could grow your own lemons.

They should do okay in your backyard if you water them regularly."
saplings2,saplings3,🧒🏽,green,"Oooh, that sounds like fun!
Wouldn't that take a long time though?"
saplings3,saplings4,🏪,pink,"Hah! I guess it would, at least 5-6 years.
There are no magic shortcuts when it comes to stuff like this."

saplings5,saplings6,🧒🏽,green,"What do you mean, @👁️‍🗨️? 😲"
saplings6,saplings7,👁️‍🗨️,white,"Easiest just to show you, I'll be right over..."
saplings7,saplings8,🧒🏽,green,"@🏪, I'm coming to buy one of your saplings!
I have a magic potion that will make them grow super fast."
saplings8,,🏪,pink,"I don't know what @👁️‍🗨️ told you, but I don't think that's a real thing. 😕
I'll gladly sell you a sapling if you want one though. Just don't expect too much."
