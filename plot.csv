start1,start2,🧒🏽,green,"Hello @everybody! I'm Carmo and I'm 11 years old!
I'm selling lemonade in front of our house just off the praça, come buy some please! 💖"
start2,,🦜,,"Hi @🧒🏽, That's so cute! I'll come take a look right now!"
sale1,sale2,🦜,,"That hit the spot, highly recommended!"
sale2,sale3,🧒🏽,green,"Thank you for your business, @🦜!"
sale3,,🐶,,"Hmm, I could use a refreshing drink too. ☀️ 👍
I'll be there in a bit."
out_of_lemons1,,🧒🏽,green,"Uh oh, I'm out of lemons. Hang on, I have to go grab some more from the store. Back in a bit!"
bought_lemons1,bought_lemons2,🧒🏽,green,"There we go, lemons back in stock. Thanks, @🏪!"
bought_lemons2,bought_lemons3,🏪,pink,"Happy to help a fellow businesswoman! 😹

We have plenty of other things in stock if your business takes off and you have more money to spend."
bought_lemons3,bought_lemons4,🧒🏽,green,"Ooh, like what? 😲"
bought_lemons4,bought_lemons5,🏪,pink,"Well, we have some very nice glitter glue pens so you can make a fancy sign for your lemonade business."
bought_lemons5,bought_lemons_final,🏪,pink,"🤔 And I guess we also have an ice machine in stock if you’re running out of that a lot, that one’s kind of expensive though."
bought_lemons_final,,🧒🏽,green,I’ll think about it! They sound very useful.
bought_glitter_pens1,bought_glitter_pens2,🏪,pink,"Thank you for stopping by and showing me the sign you drew with the glitter pens, @🧒🏽.
It was very impressive!"
bought_glitter_pens2,bought_glitter_pens3,🧒🏽,green,I bet people will come buy lemonade twice as fast now!
bought_glitter_pens3,,🏪,pink,"I wouldn’t be surprised, yeah. 🙂"
bought_ice_machine1,bought_ice_machine2,🧒🏽,green,"That new ice machine is so fast! I really like it!
Do you have another one?"
bought_ice_machine2,,🏪,pink,"Just how much lemonade do you think you’re going to sell?! 🤣
I’ll have to order in a new one, they take up quite a bit of space and don’t usually sell all that quickly."
misc1,,🏖️,,"Just what I needed after a day in the sun, thank you @🧒🏽!"
misc2,,🐶,,"I just can't get enough of this lemonade, it's delicious.
🍹✨"
misc3,,🏍️,,"Thanks for letting me fill up my thermos with lemonade, that should keep me going on my tour of the island today."
misc4,,🏖️,,This really is excellent lemonade. 💛
misc5,,🏍️,,"...I accidentally drank it all before lunch, I’ll come by for a refill in a bit!"
misc6,misc7,🐶,,More lemonade! Give me more!
misc7,,🏍️,,"Are you doing okay there, @🐶?
It is good though, I’ll admit I could go for some more as well."
saplings1,saplings2,🏪,pink,"If you're interested, @🧒🏽, I can also sell you some lemon tree saplings so you could grow your own lemons.

They should do okay in your backyard if you water them regularly."
saplings2,saplings3,🧒🏽,green,"Oooh, that sounds like fun!
Wouldn't that take a long time though?"
saplings3,saplings4,🏪,pink,"Hah! I guess it would, at least 5-6 years.
There are no magic shortcuts when it comes to stuff like this."
saplings4,saplings5,👁️‍🗨️,white,That's not <b>entirely</b> true...
saplings5,saplings6,🧒🏽,green,"What do you mean, @👁️‍🗨️? 😲"
saplings6,,👁️‍🗨️,white,"Easiest just to show you, I'll be right over..."
saplings7,saplings8,🧒🏽,green,"@🏪, I'm coming to buy one of your saplings!
I have a magic potion that will make them grow super fast."
saplings8,,🏪,pink,"I don't know what @👁️‍🗨️ told you, but I don't think that's a real thing. 😕
I'll gladly sell you a sapling if you want one though. Just don't expect too much."
worried_store1,worried_store2,🏪,pink,"@everybody I’m not sure what is going on today, but I’m going to have to limit the amount of lemons people are allowed to buy to 1 bag each."
worried_store2,worried_store3,🦜,,That’s so unfair!
worried_store3,worried_store4,🏪,pink,"@🦜 if I wouldn’t, I’d be out in the next hour.
People have really been going crazy today…"
worried_store4,worried_store5,🧒🏽,green,"I’m sorry, @🏪! I know I bought a bunch of them."
worried_store5,worried_store6,🏪,pink,"You’re fine, @🧒🏽. Don’t worry. 😊
Some other people just are going crazy for them today."
worried_store6,worried_store7,🐶,,"We need more lemons!
You can’t cut us off like this."
worried_store7,,🏪,pink,"Wah, cut you off? You’re worrying me, @🐶.
Also, I can’t stop you from chomping down on lemons as soon as you’ve paid for them, but, uh…
(Yes, I saw you.)"
